Just One Desk Next Gen Agent Tab for TED
===========

(A Chrome Extension)
--------------------

Upon opening/navigating to a new Desk Next Gen agent tab, this extension closes any earlier, duplicate tabs in the same window.

Before closing the tabs, a notification is displayed. Clicking the notification within a brief delay (~5 seconds) prevents the tabs from being closed.
